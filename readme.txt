**Click to Tweet: A Plugin for Twitter boxes**

Click to Tweet is the easiest way to promote your content and encourage your audience to share it on Twitter through active prompts and optimal usability.

So how does it work? After installation and activation, bloggers and content managers can create click to tweet text or image boxes comprised of relevant excerpts from a blog post or page. Because the plugin accommodates a myriad of styles, if there’s new or revised content to disperse, Click to Tweet can facilitate it via highly customizable displays and themed templates.

Click to Tweet is the professional, noninvasive way to ask subscribers and visitors to share content while giving them a single-click pathway to completion. If you want your content to be shared, you absolutely must make it easy.

Click to Tweet is successful because of its simple, effective promotion that adheres to the character count parameters of Twitter. You can also include Twitter usernames automatically to increase social media followers even more!

**Plugin Features**

* Both the app and plugin are free to install and include five full-featured links with an automatic URL shortening service, full scale tracking including location, and analytics to monitor site traffic and overall engagement.
* Upgrades to unlimited plans are available for an affordable cost of $4.97 per month for Pro and $49.70 per year for Expert (receive 2 months free). Both membership options include unlimited links.
* Link tracking allows users to take advantage of automatic link shortening and statistics of each embedded link. Click tracking provides detailed analytics on the Click to Tweet link such as total number, date, and location of clicks.
* Click to Tweet links are automatically embedded and fully editable. Links can be categorized using folders by topic, date range, etc. for quick reference.
* Lots of themes to choose from to really make your tweetable links stand out!  Fully customize the display box that appears including colors, text, images, and more.
